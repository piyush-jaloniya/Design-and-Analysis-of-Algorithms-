Project: Dynamic Inventory System with Knapsack-Based Profit Optimization

This project presents a dynamic inventory management system that optimizes profit by leveraging the fractional knapsack algorithm. Designed as a user-friendly application with a graphical interface built in Python's Tkinter library, this system enables users to manage items within limited storage capacity efficiently. Users can add, update, and remove items from the inventory, specifying details such as item name, weight, and profit. By applying the knapsack algorithm, the system identifies the optimal selection of items to maximize profit when faced with space constraints.

The fractional knapsack approach calculates the maximum achievable profit by prioritizing items based on their profit-to-weight ratio, allowing for both full and partial inclusion of items. This strategic method aligns with real-world inventory challenges, particularly in fields like e-commerce and retail, where maximizing profit from limited storage is essential.

In addition to the core functionalities, the project report covers the project's aim, objectives, and a detailed overview of the implementation and expected outputs. It concludes with potential future enhancements, including database integration and advanced filtering, and outlines key learning outcomes, such as practical applications of Python, Tkinter, and optimization algorithms. This project not only strengthens skills in Python and algorithmic thinking but also offers valuable insights into inventory management and profit maximization strategies.
